        My general wish for this blog is to be a space where I am forced to
        flesh out my thoughts. During my time in college, I found that writing
        is the best method for thinking deeply, and I'm also hoping that the
        push to publish it on a public site will augment the benefit of just
        writing for myself. I don't really care who is reading it; in fact, I
        consciously am never going to add engagement features like liking,
        sharing, commenting, etc., so that I never have to think about who is
        reading. There just has to be the possibility that somebody could be
        reading so that I can orient my voice to the general reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's fitting, then, that my first <b>real</b> post (disregarding the
        Hello World test post that seems to be a requirement for all developer
        blogs) is an attempt to concretize my ideas about my current side
        project.
      </p>
      <h2>Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        There seem to be two veins of personal budgetting apps, where the
        primary differentiator is the level of manual control given to the user:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <aside>
          <p>[1] <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/">Mint Mobile</a></p>
        </aside>
        <li>
          Hands-off apps: Auto-pulls transactions from your various cards and
          bank accounts, auto-categorizes them, auto-budgets. Examples: Mint
          Mobile [1].
        </li>
        <aside>
          <p>
            [2]
            <a href="https://plaintextaccounting.org/">Plaintext Accounting</a>
          </p>
        </aside>
        <li>
          Hands-on apps: Manual entering of transactions, manual categorization,
          manual analysis. Examples: Plaintext accounting [2].
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've experimented with both hands-off and hands-on apps, and I find that
        I lean towards the latter. Indeed, I have the same preference for
        minimal computer intervention apps for all uses, despite my profession
        as a software developer. This will be another blog post for another day,
        but, briefly, I think that apps shouldn't get too smart: they should be
        optimizing our daily workflows without ever taking away control. Once
        these hands-off apps start guessing how much you should be spending
        based on how much you spent in previous apps, I get uncomfortable, and I
        think you should, too. Security is another concern with the hands-off
        apps; do I really want Ryan Reynolds, owner of Mint Mobile, to own all
        my transaction data, all the credentials to my financial accounts, and
        already compiled analytics of my personal spending happens? Hell, no.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I favor the hands-off apps. The lineage of these apps can be traced
        back to the most manual accounting that you can do: a hand-written
        ledger. This is honestly a really good solution in the face of all the
        high tech solutions that the industry is churning out. It's incredibly
        secure (depending on your ability to not misplace the notebook),
        categorization is as easy as physical filing, and the actual act of
        writing in a transaction gives more meaning to using money in a world
        where I can spend thousands of dollars at once with the swipe of a
        little plastic card. The downsides of this approach are that it's hard
        to run analysis of your spending habits without either fast calculator
        skills or entering all of the data into a computer, and that you have to
        either lug around your budgetting notebook or the receipts of your daily
        transactions in order to log them by hand. This has led many to use
        spreadsheet software as their budgeting apps, and this, too, is a great
        solution that solves both of the downsides of the hand-written ledger.

        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        I've been experimenting with Google Sheets for a few months, and it
        seems to be an almost-perfect approach. You get all of the benefits of
        the hand-written ledger outlined above, and you also get as many
        analysis reports as your data-loving heart wishes through the
        spreadsheet formula language, which became Turing complete last year
        [3]. Now, the only downside (oh, those pesky downsides) is that
        spreadsheet software works like absolute hot garbage on mobile
        platforms. The benefit of having a virtual ledger is that I can access
        it from anywhere, but the dismal UX of mobile spreadsheet apps means I
        never want to actually open the Google sheets app (why is startup so
        slow??) and enter in my data after zooming-in and out trying to find
        where I am in the sheet.
      </p>
      <h2>Enter, Moolah (name pending)</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of my budget app tries to improve on the options detailed
        above by including all the analytics wins from using spreadsheet
        formulas, while solving for the data entry problem by having a
        mobile-first app design for transaction viewing and entry. It's a very
        simple concept, but I haven't found anyone who has done it before in an
        implementation that I like. People have created hacky approaches of a
        web frontend with a Google Sheets backend, but I don't want the ugly
        spreadsheets to be a part of the process at all. It's not like I'm
        constantly writing new and different reports; I want to spend some
        upfront effort writing a collection of reports that I want to see, and
        then I want to easily view those reports with updated data in my hand.
      </p>

      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <p>We may then separate the two main concerns of the app as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Data entry in a clean, mobile-first design</li>
        <li>Robust, custom data analytics</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        For the first concern, I plan to create a PWA with a minimalistic design
        for viewing and adding transactions. The app must be very usable through
        touch controls, and above all, it must be blazing fast. Currently, I am
        writing a Next + React app, but I may move to vanilla HTML/CSS/jQuery as
        required. This concern need only support the basic options like
        transaction amount, type, category, date, description, and notes. I have
        compiled this list of properties by looking at both hands-off app
        transaction properties and widely-used, premade Google Sheets. Each
        transaction should be editable and deleteable.
      </p>
      <p>
        (This obviously requires some kind of data storage strategy. Currently,
        I am using a Supabase PostgreSQL database for all users, but I will
        detail future plans in the extensions section below.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For the second concern, I plan to create a Javascript scripting editor.
        The user's script will run in an environment with all of their
        transaction data and access to some kind of data vizualisation library.
        Here are some examples of analysis scripts one might create:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a pie chart of the current month's spending in each category.
        </li>

        <li>Create a line chart of past spending by month.</li>

        <li>
          Create a bar chart that details how much of each budget category they
          have spent and how much they have remaining in the month. This may
          require that the environment also has access to some kind of input
          controls (such as defining category budget amounts).
        </li>
        <li>
          This second concern is really the part that excites me the most
          technologically. I am currently finishing up an MVP for the first
          concern, and I will most likely post another blog post mid-way through
          the second concern.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Extensions</h2>
      <p>
        I think it's always good to have some dreams about a project, even if
        you may never get to them. These are what I call "extensions". With my
        current project, I've thought about the following extensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <aside>
          <p>
            [4]
            <a href="https://remotestorage.io/">remoteStorage.js</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            [5]
            <a href="https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js/"
              >GitHub - sql-js/sql.js: A javascript library to run SQLite on the
              web.</a
            >
          </p>
        </aside>
        <li>
          Data ownership. I don't want to own my user's transaction data or
          worry about security. Lately, I have been reading about
          remoteStorage.js [4]. This library allows users to self-host a
          key-value storage while providing tools for app developers to
          interface with each user's storage *in an offline-first strategy*.
          This is really cool, but I need a SQL database. I think I want to
          combine it with sql.js [5]. This library compiles SQLite to WASM or JS
          to run in the browser. I am imagining an offline-first, self-hosted
          storage solution. That would be cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Analytics marketplace. Many users might not be interested in or have
          the knowledge to create their own analysis reports with JS. I want to
          have a (free) marketplace where other users have written reports that
          can be imported in to one's own account.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'll keep the blog updated with any progress I make on the app! That's
        all for now...
