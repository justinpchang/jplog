        There is so much information about sourdough online and a lot of it
        directly contradicts each other. Below, I’ve tried to compile what I
        know works from my research and experience. You’ll ultimately have to do
        your own research and find what works out for you in your environment
        through experimentation and recording your results, but this should be a
        good starting place.
      </p>
      <h2 id="all-about-starter">All about starter</h2>
      <h3 id="what-is-a-sourdough-starter-">What is a sourdough starter?</h3>
      <p>
        Sourdough starter is a natural yeast that is fed with flour and water.
        During the process of making a starter, we are trying to capture a
        specific strain of yeast out of the air and feeding it over a long
        period of time so that it outlives other types of yeast and bacteria in
        the starter. Now that you have a stable starter, you don’t have to worry
        about that. Now, you just need to feed it.
      </p>
      <h3 id="why-feed-sourdough-starter-">Why feed sourdough starter?</h3>
      <p>
        The starter is a living thing, so you need to constantly feed it to keep
        it alive. Like a pet. When you feed it the flour and water mixture, the
        yeasts work hard to digest all the food. In this digestion process, it
        creates a lot of carbon dioxide byproduct, just like when we breathe
        out. This carbon dioxide emission is the gas that causes bread dough to
        rise during bulk fermentation or to spring in the oven.
      </p>
      <h3 id="when-to-feed-sourdough-starter">
        When to feed sourdough starter
      </h3>
      <p>
        The more consistently you feed your starter, the more active and alive
        it becomes. This means you’ll have much better bread. A very alive and
        well starter will double in size at around 4 hours after feeding, and it
        will continue until it has tripled in size over the next few hours after
        that. This timeline is affected by ambient temperature as well (warmer
        environment means greater activity means faster rise). At some point,
        the starter reaches it’s “peak” which is the highest it will rise in
        that feed. It will stay there for around an hour, then it will start to
        collapse and fall, slowly reaching its original size in around 12 hours
        after feeding. It’s falling because it’s “hungry,” i.e. it needs to be
        fed again because it has run out of usable food.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will notice the starter change texture over the course of this
        lifecycle. When the starter is hungry, such as when you are about to
        feed it or equivalently 12 hours after feeding, the mixture will be very
        slack and loose. When the starter has been fed and is rising quickly,
        there will be some structure to it from the gluten that is developing in
        the mixture. When the starter is at peak, it will be very gassy and
        bubbly from how much CO2 has been off-gassed.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can build a very active starter by making sure it never gets very
        hungry. This generally means feeding it every 8-12 hours when you are
        keeping your starter at room temp. This seems like a lot of work! But
        thankfully, you can take long breaks if you don’t plan on baking soon.
      </p>
      <h3 id="keeping-starter-in-the-fridge">Keeping starter in the fridge</h3>
      <p>
        Recall that a colder environment slows down fermentation while a warmer
        environment speeds up fermentation. If you throw your starter into the
        fridge (optimally around 38 to 42 deg F), it will slow to the point that
        it won’t become very hungry or die for months. So, if you don’t plan on
        baking bread in the next few days, throw your starter in the fridge and
        you don’t have to worry about it! When you do want to bake, bring your
        starter out a day or two ahead and start feeding it every 8-12 hours
        again just to wake it up and strengthen it in preparation for your bake.
      </p>
      <h2 id="steps-to-feed-sourdough-starter">
        Steps to feed sourdough starter
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Empty all of your starter into a spare bowl</li>
        <li>
          Rinse out your empty starter jar (this ensures there is no dried
          starter residue build up that can cause mold and kill your starter!)
        </li>
        <li>Add X grams of starter back into your jar</li>
        <li>Add X grams of All Purpose flour into your jar</li>
        <li>Add X grams of water into your jar</li>
        <li>
          Mix the starter, flour, and water until a homogenous mixture forms
        </li>
        <li>
          Use your spoon or a wet paper towel to wipe down the insides of your
          jar
        </li>
        <li>
          Mark the current level of your starter on the outside of a jar with a
          rubber band so you can measure how much it has risen over time
        </li>
        <li>
          The rest of the starter in the bowl is called “discard.” Empty this
          into a big container in the fridge of older discard to use in
          “sourdough discard” recipes (described later). Or you can just throw
          it away.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="how-to-calculate-x-above">How to calculate X above</h3>
      <p>
        You will notice in the recipe that we are doing a 1:1:1 ratio of
        starter:flour:water when feeding the starter. Using baker percentages,
        this can also be written as keeping the starter at 100% hydration. This
        is a good starting place that won’t fail you, but as you get more
        experience, you can play around with modifying this. The best thing
        about sourdough baking is how much optimization and data collection you
        can get into if you want. For example, my best breads come from a
        feeding schedule of 1:4:4 → 8 hours → 1:3:3 → 6 hours → 1:2:2 → 4 hours
        → BAKE!
      </p>
      <p>
        So, back to calculating X. This depends on what you are using your
        starter for. For example, if the bread recipe I am going to bake calls
        for 100g starter, I will make sure to feed so that I have at least 120g
        or so of starter by the time I am going to add the starter to the dough.
        120g of starter equates to X=40g. So the feed right before baking would
        have to be 40g starter, 40g water, 40g flour (if using a 1:1:1 ratio).
        But the feed before that could be 15g:15g:15g to get you the ~40g of
        starter you needed for the pre-bread feed. In this way, you can plan
        ahead and change your feed amounts accordingly so that you don’t have to
        discard so much. My minimum amount of starter that I’ve found still
        works well is 8g. Accordingly, my minimum ratio of sourdough to food
        that I use is 1:12 or so (ex: 10g starter, 60g water, 60g flour) before
        the starter is kind of “drowned” in food and takes a long time to peak.
      </p>
      <p>
        My standard feed is 20g:20g:20g. This lets me accumulate discard at a
        rate that fits how much I bake, and it also makes sure I have enough
        active starter on hand to make at least 1 medium loaf if the urge ever
        hits me.
      </p>
      <h3 id="sourdough-discard">Sourdough discard</h3>
      <p>
        The discard step at each feed can feel really wasteful at first. But you
        can use that discard in baking too. It doesn’t have much special
        fermentation powers anymore like active sourdough starter, but it is
        still just a flour and water mixture. Just with a TON of yummy, tangy
        flavor. In fact, discard that has been sitting in the fridge for 2 weeks
        or so has BETTER sour flavor than active starter. You can sub it into
        any recipe that uses flour and water pretty much for a special kick.
        I’ll include some favorites below.

      <p>
        This loaf is usually shaped into a boule (the round one) or batard (the
        longer one somewhere in between boule and baguette). It has a crunchy
        crust with soft and fluffy interior. Sourdough enthusiasts usually also
        shoot for an “open crumb” with these loaves, which just means that the
        inside has lots of large and small holes distributed evenly throughout
        the bread.

          is a GREAT starting point. This is the basis of my go to recipe. It
          introduces you the main kneading/structuring methods you’ll see in
          every recipe: stretch and fold, coil folds, and my personal favorite,
          lamination. This recipe is high labor, but in the end, it really is
          worth it. Don’t worry about following the starter feed schedule she
          has in the video to a T, it doesn’t really matter.

          is a more friendly recipe that still produces a great loaf. This is
          what I personally started with. The Perfect Loaf site, where this
          recipe comes from, is also a goldmine of sourdough information. Check
          out some of the guides on his site if you want to learn tips, tricks,
          and hacks about sourdough.

          recipe is good and well known on the internet and will give you a good

          course of making bread.

          are AMAZING. I make these all the time with my discard. You can add
          whatever mix-ins you want (I usually add some kind of salty aged
          cheese and some Italian herbs or go all in on a cheez it replica)! You
          can make a big batch and freeze chunks of dough for months later if
          you ever mismanage and accidentally accumulate too much discard.
          They’re super easy to make too.

          >
          are also a classic. You can make any kind of savory pancake by adding
          discard and a little bit of flour and water until you get a pancake
          consistency. Then mix in anything like scallions or chives or I’ve
          even done cilantro, throw into a skillet with oil on medium low. This
          produces a great tangy and salty snack.

          don’t make a very good pretzel, but I usually create this dough and
          then wrap it around some hotdogs, blanch in baking soda and boiling
          water, and then bake with some flaky salt and a cheese dip. Delicious!

          >
          are also a good way to use up sourdough discard in your normal
          cooking. As I said before, you can just throw it into any recipe as a
          flour and water replacement for the extra tang.

          These brownies are a great way to learn how to incorporate the
          sourness of starter in a way that doesn’t make the end product sour
          but just brings out all the other flavors. It uses the sourdough
          starter as the X-factor in these brownies.

          I generally stay away from King Arthur’s recipes for any actual bread
          recipes (but their flour is the gold standard). I’ve had bad
          experience with them and don’t find them to be very consistent or as
          well-researched as some of the stuff I’ve linked above.
        </li>
        <li>
          You really don’t need too many of these recipes. My recommendation is
          to find one that you find clear and mildly entertaining (you’ll watch
          it a bunch). Then keep making that over and over. Keep the recipe
          constant so you can improve technique.

      <h2 id="miscellanous-tips">Miscellanous tips</h2>
      <h3 id="autolyzing-is-a-myth">Autolyzing is a myth</h3>
      <p>
        In many recipes (especially the first one that I linked), the baker
        calls for first mixing the flour and water together and letting it sit
        for up to 3 hours?! Then mix in the starter/levain, wait again, then mix
        in the salt. The rationale for this is that you want to let the water
        fully hydrate the flour and then let it sit to start building up some
        gluten naturally. Then you need to mix in the starter before the salt
        otherwise it incorporates inconsistently or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is bogus in my experience. In any recipe that calls for something
        like this, I usually just add the starter directly to the water with the
        salt so that it disolves much much more easily. Then add in the flour to
        all of that. And cut out all the waiting time (but make sure you adjust
        when you feed the starter accordingly). I get the exact same results as
        when I autolyze. There are lots of videos and info online about this
        debate.
      </p>
      <h3 id="what-flour-to-use">What flour to use</h3>
      <p>
        Again, lots of recommendations online, and many of those recommendations
        conflict with one another. Currently, I’m going with 100% AP flour when
        feeding my starter, then my ratios vary during bread-making. I usually
        include at least 20% whole wheat (as a baker’s percentage) because I
        find the fully white loaves just a bit too much. I need some of the
        earthiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common recommendation here is to feed your starter with the same flour
        ratios that you use in your bread, but pulling out two types of flour
        every time I feed is just a bit too excessive for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others say only ever feed the starter with organic rye, and just don’t
        do that. Way too expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do always try to go with KA flour. Their AP is already such a high
        protein content that you can use it in place of any European’s recipe
        that calls for “strong bread flour.” Their other flour options are also
        all solid.
      </p>
      <h3 id="dealing-with-the-weather">Dealing with the weather</h3>
      <p>
        The sweet spot for sourdough fermentation (for feeding and bread-making)
        is around 75 deg F ambient temperature. This is hard to achieve by just
        using your house AC. Right now, in Vermont winter, the ambient
        temperature in the apartment is around 64 deg F, which throws off all my
        timing and slows everything down. So my solution is to keep the starter
        or rising bread dough in a shut oven. Every so often, I’ll turn it on to
        heat for a few mins at the lowest setting until it reaches around 80
        deg. When I leave it off and closed, it works its way back down to 68
        deg or so overnight, so not so bad!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use a proofing box that you buy online. I’m attempting to
        make my own soon, and I’ll let you know how it goes. The biggest thing
        is you just need to keep track of the variables and try to stay
        consistent!
      </p>
      <h3 id="record-everything-to-improve">Record everything to improve</h3>
      <p>
        The first bread may not be perfect. Or if it is, the second bread will
        somehow not work despite following all the same instructions.
        Consistency really is the key. Control as much as you can so that you
        can change one thing at a time and see how your bread reacts. I keep a
        notebook where I just write down any sourdough related activities and
        observations. In it, I keep track of of course what I’m doing, but also
        ambient temperature, dough temperature using an instant read
        thermometer, how the starter smells, how the dough feels, how it reacts
        to kneading or shaping, how it bakes, everything! Over time, you start
        to see trends and work your way towards your perfect loaf.
      </p>
      <h3 id="scoring">Scoring</h3>
      <p>
        The “ear” is that little lip on the top of sourdough loaves that rises.
        Bakers LOVE a huge ear, something you can lift the loaf by! It’s partly
        an aesthetic choice, a fashion, but it also is a good indicator that you
        did everything right throughout the baking process, similar to an open
        crumb. One of the biggest things from stopping people from having a good
        ear even when everything else is good is the scoring technique.
        Basically, you want a very clean cut at around a 45 deg angle from end
        to end in a straight line on the top of the loaf. The clean cut
        necessitates a razor blade or a bread lame (which is just a razor blade
        attached to a stick). A sharp knife really won’t cut it here. To make
        the bread more receptive to a clean cut, keep it in the fridge until
        right when you’re about to put it in the oven (see the end of the first

      <h3 id="oven-spring">Oven spring</h3>
      <p>
        Oven spring refers to how much the dough rises in the oven. You want it
        to rise a ton, blowing out the top of the dough at the score and
        creating a big beautiful ear.
      </p>

        Steam is really the name of the game here. Dutch oven works because it
        traps in the steam that the dough lets out. The steam ensures that the
        top of the dough doesn’t harden too quickly in the high heat so that the
        insides can spring open. Too much steam, though, will cause your crust
        to never fully form. So, just like all of sourdough baking, it’s all
        about finding the perfect sweet spot.

      <h3 id="baking-vessels">Baking vessels</h3>
      <p>
        The dutch oven is the easiest and most popular baking vessel. Preheat
        the dutch oven as hot as it goes, put the dough inside with the lid on,
        bake for 20 mins, then remove lid and lower heat, and bake for another
        20 mins or until dark and crispy.

        The way that works the best for me is actually using a baking stone.
        Preheat the stone, then use a pizza peel to put the dough on top. Cover
        with a big upside down roasting tin with a few ice cubes underneath to
        produce steam. Then bake for 20, remove cover and lower heat, and bake
        for 20 more until done.

      <h3 id="fermentation">Fermentation</h3>
      <p>
        Another factor in oven spring is your fermentation level. You want to
        bake your dough right at the perfect level of fermentation. The same
        process that causes the starter to rise after feeding is what causes the
        dough to expand and then the bread to rise in the oven. So it’s all
        about timing. Too soon (underfermented, underproofed), and you dough
        creates uneven, huge bubbles because it rose “too” fast. This creates
        what’s called “fool’s crumb” because it looks good at first glance, but
        its uneven distribution reveals underfermentation. Too late
        (overfermented, overproofed), and the dough is slack, doesn’t shape
        well, and won’t spring much. Fermentation level is really the hardest
        thing to nail down for me because it depends on so many different
        factors (how active the starter is, what kind of feeding regimen it’s
        used to, how much water you use in the dough, the temperature of the
        environment and the dough, how much you knead and structure the dough,
        etc.).

      <h3 id="aliquot-jars">Aliquot jars</h3>
      <p>
        This is a technique I’m just experimenting with now that can help you
        time your proof just right. The basic idea is right at your first
        stretch and fold, chop off a bit of dough and put it into a small,
        narrow but tall vessel. Then you can more easily see cues like when the
        dough has 1.5x or doubled in size than an amorphous blob in a bowl. The
        tricky part is keeping the jar at the exact same temp as your dough
        (which changes temp due to its larger surface area, different
        material/density, amount of handling, gluten development, etc.).
