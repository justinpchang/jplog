        This post contains some notes I took while reading through the
        <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki">Sidekiq Github wiki</a
        >. These notes assume that you already have a basic working experience
        with Sidekiq, including creating and managing jobs. As such, it skips
        over those basics.
      </p>
      <h2>Basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Workers get 25 seconds to shutdown in the case of Heroku restart,
          etc., and any remaining jobs are pushed back to the queue.
          <ul>
            <li>This entails jobs should not be very long running.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          You can either enqueue jobs by calling <code>perform_now</code>,
          <code>perform_in</code>, or <code>perform_async</code> on the Job
          Class, or you can use the generic
          <code
            >Sidekiq::Client.push(&#39;class&#39; =&gt; JobClass, &#39;args&#39;
            =&gt; [...])</code
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Arguments must be simple JSON datatypes since they are serialized into
          a string in Redis.
        </li>
        <li>
          Jobs should be idempotent, meaning that they should be able to be
          <strong>safely</strong> executed multiple times.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Due to Sidekiqâ€™s retry functionality as well as having the Redis
              queue live separately from the main app and database, there is
              <strong>no guarantee</strong>
              that jobs are only executed once. Even first-time successful jobs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          By default, each Sidekiq process has 10 threads, but you can adjust it
          with parameter or environment variable.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Should not go above 10, and 5 is recommended for Heroku 1x or 2x
              dynos.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Sidekiq bundles <code>connection_pool</code> to limit database
          connections if necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Redis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cloud-based Redis deployments can face errors from network timeouts.
          If this is the case, experiment with increasing the timeout which is
          defaulted to 1 second.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set <code>maxmemory-policy noeviction</code> in
          <code>redis.conf</code> so Redis doesn&rsquo;t drop Sidekiq&rsquo;s
          data silently.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Error handling and debugging</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Connect an error service to Sidekiq and then let Sidekiq catch job
          exceptions to take advantage of error reporting and automatic retry.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don&rsquo;t need to manually connect the error service in most
              cases. Each Sidekiq job spawns our entire Rails env for access to
              the Rails API, but it has the side benefit that normal error gems
              are already loaded in. Like how we get Rollbar errors for Sidekiq
              jobs already.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Automatic retry follows exponential backoff according to
          <code>(retry_count ** 4) + 15 + (rand(10) * (retry_count + 1))</code>
          which equates to 25 retries over 21 days. After that point, a job is
          moved to the Dead Job queue where it can be manually retried before
          being dropped after 6 months.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Configure max retries in <code>sidekiq.yml</code> or per job using
              the <code>retry</code> <code>sidekiq_options</code> in the Job
              Class
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          To send TTIN to a worker process:
          <code>Sidekiq::ProcessSet.new.each {|ps| ps.dump_threads }</code>
        </li>

          <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/API">here</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          View signals documentation
          <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Signals">here</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Multiple queues</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Why?
          <ul>
            <li>Ability to stop one job type but keep others running.</li>
            <li>Different priorities and time urgencies.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Each queue can be configured with a weight for processing. Setting
          each queue with a weight of 1 will give random queue priorities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Define which queue in the Job Class by using the
          <code>queue</code> <code>sidekiq_options</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not have many queues per Sidekiq process to avoid complexity
          (including exponential polling the Redis process for each additional
          queue). Instead, use multiple Sidekiq processes that handle different
          queues.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Logging</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each job can use <code>logger.info</code> or
          <code>logger.debug</code> to access the Sidekiq logger
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sharding</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Not really necessary since Sidekiq is incredibly efficient (~25,000
          jobs/second)
        </li>
        <li>
          After that point, view this
          <a href="https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/wiki/Sharding">doc</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Extensions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Some things like job retry, batching, and rate limiting are behind the
          Sidekiq paywall, but most things have an open source alternative.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Serial execution</h2>
      <p>
        For my own use case, serial execution is something unavoidable. I'll
        detail my approach for this in a different blog post. So long!
