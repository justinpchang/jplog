        Well, we're coming up on two consecutive months without posting, which
        means that this blog experiment has been a failure. Which is okay, of
        course. I probably have 10 times more failed projects than deployed
        projects. That rate seems okay to me, but that's a blog post for another
        day. Maybe. If the blog still exists. This is like my fourth try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because the blog project has failed so far doesn't mean that I'm
        going to give up on it, though! I'm giving it another shot now by
        rewriting the static site generator behind this website... Or really I'm
        removing the static site generator. I am now the static site generator.
        This is my static site. Look around you. All of this is just native HTML
        + CSS. Absolutely no interactivity, no Javascript. It's honestly a
        breath of fresh air from the React I write in my day job. Fiddling with
        blog tech instead of writing posts seems like the kind of counter
        productive activity that has caused all of my past blogging attempts to
        fail, but it has led me to write this blog post. And this blog post
        thankfully resets the <code>TIME SINCE LAST BLOG</code> counter so that
        I don't have to feel so bad about leaving the site unattended until at
        least two more months.
      </p>
      <p>
        The core of this rewrite is just going back to the basics and serving a
        totally static site. This page is just an HTML document that I wrote by
        hand, linked to a CSS stylesheet that I also wrote by hand. The
        index/main page are also just HTML documents that I will manually
        maintain by copying and pasting the formatting for linking to my most
        recent post.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't really written static HTML/CSS websites since I learned how to
        code during my fourth (?) grade summer technology camp. It's pretty
        enjoyable, though, to write in semantic HTML5. To run a blog like this,
        all it requires is settling on a common structure for each page. Then,
        one stylesheet can be created that targets tags instead of classes or
        ids which makes the HTML document much cleaner. Check out the source
        code of this page to see the structure I've settled on. I just have one
        big <code>content</code> div that supports headings, paragraphs, lists,
        and asides, so far. Images and code blocks are coming soon, then at that
        point, we'll have all the tools we need to write any sort of blog post.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was worried that having to write raw HTML as opposed to markdown would
        increase the effort required in writing each post, but that really
        doesn't seem to be the case. I'm writing this post now in VSCode,
        split-screened with an HTML preview window. I quite like this set up. It
        is perhaps a little less immersive and focussed than, say, a fullscreen
        Notion session, but that also might be a good thing. Processes that feel
        scrappy are easy to jump in and lab something out, whereas I've found
        that processes that feel clean and efficient and well-structured give me
        the impression that what I'm producing within those processes better
        have the same quality. Which, of course, then leads to perfectionism
        paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        So my theory is that by writing within this suboptimal
        experience&mdash;with VSCode trying to code auto-complete every single
        word I type with Emmet Abbreviations, with paragraphs running off the
        right side of the page unless I enable Prettier word wrap, with this
        god-awful default HTML tag auto-close that never closes the tag how I
        want it&mdash;I will hopefully feel more at ease with writing freely and
        thus more frequently. We'll see how it actually turns out. Stay tuned.
